# SkriptAI

SkriptAI is an addon for [SkEditor](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skeditor.108251/), the modern IDE for Skript language development. This project adds a Gemini AI powered chat sidebar directly into SkEditor, designed to help you write, debug, and learn Skript more efficiently.

## What is this?

SkriptAI integrates Google Gemini AI chat into SkEditor as a native sidebar panel. You can ask questions, get code suggestions, and receive contextual help while working on your Skript projects all without leaving the editor.

## Features

- **AI Chat Sidebar:** Chat with Gemini AI right inside SkEditor.
- **Contextual Assistance:** The AI can use your selected text or file contents for more relevant answers.
- **skUnity Docs Integration:** Automatically fetches and includes relevant documentation from [skUnity](https://docs.skunity.com/syntax) to improve AI responses.
- **Modern UI:** The chat panel is styled to match modern developer tools, with a seamless input area and selectable chat history.
- **Easy to Use:** Just open the sidebar, enter your Gemini API key, and start chatting.
